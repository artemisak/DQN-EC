## Graph Autoencoder

This project includes an implementation of a **Graph AutoEncoder** for encoding and reconstructing agent observations from the `simple_speaker_listener_v4` environment (from [PettingZoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/)). It uses a ** kNN graph with Gabriel pruning** and a bunch of other conventional methods building latent graph representation.
