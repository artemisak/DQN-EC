## Graph Autoencoder

This project includes an implementation of a **Graph AutoEncoder** for encoding and reconstructing agent observations from the `simple_speaker_listener_v4` environment ([PettingZoo, Farama Foundation](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/)). It uses a **kNN graph with Gabriel pruning** and a bunch of other conventional methods building latent graph representation. Main results are reported at [wandb dashboard](https://api.wandb.ai/links/itmo-university-it/btgi8sdh).
